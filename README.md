bucrybapp-docker builds because my thinkpad is to weak
# crybapp-docker
because there was no official complete dockerization of [cryb](https://cryb.app). so if they will bring there own docker-images and docker-compose config I will link to them and close this repo or something... 

these configs and images are basically a docker dockerized version of [this guide ](https://cryb.d3sox.icu/installation).
it should be about the same...

### setup
1. you will need a Discord Application. how to get one explained [here](https://cryb.d3sox.icu/installation/#create-discord-application). 
2. now can download the `docker-compose.yml` and continue the setup
